# Waste Classifier using CNN

## Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based waste classification model that categorizes waste into different types for better waste management and recycling. The model is trained on an image dataset of various waste categories and can predict the class of new waste images.

## Features
- Uses CNN for accurate image classification
- Supports multiple waste categories (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic, etc.)
- Implements data preprocessing techniques for improved model performance
- Trained using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, if applicable)
- Includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into various waste types. It is split into:
- **Training set**: Used to train the model
- **Validation set**: Used to fine-tune the model
- **Test set**: Used to evaluate model performance

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-classifier.git
   cd waste-classifier
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct directory structure:
   ```
   dataset/
   |-- train/
   |   |-- images/
   |   |-- labels/
   |-- valid/
   |   |-- images/
   |   |-- labels/
   |-- test/
   |   |-- images/
   |   |-- labels/
   ```

## Usage
1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
3. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- Fully connected layers for classification
- Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Results
After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately **X%** on the test set (replace with actual results). The confusion matrix and classification report can be generated for further analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Increase dataset size for better generalization
- Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models
- Optimize hyperparameters to improve accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application
